# Project Herophilus

For many decades, healthcare has relied upon community development in areas such as treatment protocols, safety standards, 
and common data formats.  More recently, this "community" model has been used in software development; all significant 
software innovation in the past 10 years has been in open-source communities. Welcome to [Project Herophilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herophilos), this organization is intended to be an open source upstream healthcare community. The intent of this organization is two fold:
help drive open source into healthcare and demonstrate the how innovation in healthcare can drive and leverage open source to solve industry problems!!! 
Why the name? Herophilus or spelled Herophilos, was a Greek physician who is often credited with being the founder of Anatomy.  
Assets currently available provide tools for configuration, testing, data integration, synthetic data, and more - all developed and available to any organization.  Project Herophilis has made these assets available to anyone using fuilly open source software and all under Apache 2 licensing. 

Red Hat, is a leader in enterprise open source and offers support, security, services and training. In alignment with healthcare and technology's embrace of community and open source, Red Hat has been a key sponsor and supporter in establishing Project Herophilis. Red Hat is keeping its enterprise open source leading approach and operates a subset of these assets “downstream.” While the “accelerators” are provided as is, Red Hat customers can get secure and supported software the “accelerators” run atop for their production and other business needs. 

## Supporting Repositories for All Work Efforts
As you look at this page just keep in mind it is ONLY a lionding page intended to help explain all the Project Herophilus 
efforts. While there are key areas of focus for this effort we also have all out assets put into one repository for 

| Key Area | Business Purpose |
|----------|------------------|
|Project-Herophilus-Assets| Platform assets like diagrams, images, presentations, test data and industry published content.| 
|iDaaS-Addons|Add-ons to help implementations - data mappers, database files, data simulators and more.|

## Key Areas of Focus
As you look at this page just keep in mind it is ONLY a lionding page intended to help explain all the Project Herophilus 
efforts. 

| Key Area | Business Purpose |
|----------|------------------|
|DataSynthesis| The need for synthetic/fictitous data that resembles real information| 
|iDaaS-Connect| Connecting to all types of data and providing access to information in near realtime. |
|Event-Builder| A library that enables parsing, processing and transforming data while enabling various capabilities. Can be used within iDaaS or on its own. |
|iDaaS-Route| Routing of data - code and business rules based intelligent routing exist. |
|iDaaS-DReAM| Business rules based platforms designed for usage within healthcare. |
|iDaaS-KIC| Knowledge, Insight and Conformance is all about providing the ability to process errors, audit and other data. This consists of the endpoints, processing and persistence needed to support the platform.|

## Key Areas Under Consideration
Because we are involved with several industry groups and implementations we are always focused on how we can help in
more areas of healthcare.

| Key Area | Business Purpose |
|----------|------------------|
|Consent| Thinking about ways we can provide/leverage a consistent Consent platform that is open source and vendor agnostic|
