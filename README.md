# Project Herophilus

Welcome to [Project Herophilus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herophilos), this organization is intended to be an 
open source upstream healthcare community. The intent of this organization is to help drive Open Source into 
healthcare and help further demonstrate the how innovation in healthcare in driven by open source!!! Why the name? 
Herophilus, was a Greek physician who is often credited with being the founder of Anatomy. We felt this name is fitting 
as the intent of this effort is to showcase and put forward upstream open source innovation that can help simply 
healthcare's ability to access and process data.

Several of the capabilities contained within this organization are already used within other organizations and we are 
so proud that these open contributions can help our healthcare.
