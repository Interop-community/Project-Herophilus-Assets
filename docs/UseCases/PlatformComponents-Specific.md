# Implementation Based Repositories: Platform Components
These are the full specific repositories with all features enabled.


## Testing and Enablement
There are several repositories which are provided to help in implementations.

| Capability | Repository  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|Simulators|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Simulators" target="_blank">Data Simulators</a>|Simulators for HL7, FHIR. APIs and more|
|Building Fictitious Data|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/DataSynthesis" target="_blank">Data Synthesis</a>|This component is specifically designed to enable implementors to quickly build fictitious data for testing. It has over 30B data attributes including names, address, phone numbers, zip codes, company names, drivers licenses, social security numbers, credit cards, bank routing numbers and so much more.|

## Scenarios
There are several repositories provided to give end to end implementation guidance.

| Capability | Repository  | Description  |
|---|---|---|
|Receiving - HL7|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Connect/tree/master/iDaaS-Connect-HL7" target="_blank"> iDaaS Connect Clinical - HL7</a>|This iDaaS Connect accelerator specifically and ONLY supports the clinical integration standards of HL7.  From an integration connectivity and standards perspective it has HL7 MLLP Servers that support the following types from any vendor and any specific message version from 2.1 to 2.8: ADT (Admissions), ORM (Orders), ORU (Results), SCH (Schedules), PHA (Pharmacy), MFN (Master File Notifications), MDM (Medical Document Management) and VXU (Vaccinations).  This accelerator apart from handling the needed specific connectivity also does a minimal initial routing of data and has complete auditing integrated.
|Receiving - FHIR|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Connect/tree/master/iDaaS-Connect-FHIR" target="_blank"> iDaaS Connect - FHIR</a>| This iDaaS Connect accelerator specifically and ONLY  supports ALL FHIR resources.  From an integration perspective it enables processing of over 75+ specific <a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/STU3/resourcelist.html" target="_blank">FHIR resources</a> that span base, clinical, financial (all), specialized (all but testing). Another benefit of this platform is that you <b>DO NOT require a FHIR server for this be leveraged</b>. However,  It has been tested to work with several FHIR servers: HAPI JPA Server, Microsoft Azure FHIR Server and IBM FHIR Server. This accelerator apart from handling the needed specific connectivity also does a minimal initial routing of data and has complete auditing integrated.|
|Receiving - Blue Button | <a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Connect/tree/master/iDaaS-Connect-BlueButton" target="_blank"> iDaaS Connect Blue Button</a>|This iDaaS Connect accelerator specifically and ONLY  supports the critical FHIR need of processing data from BlueButton based on a series of data attributes that are passed to it.|
|Receiving - Non Industry Standard Data (i.e. - ETL, FTP, etc.)|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Connect/tree/master/iDaaS-Connect-ThirdParty" target="_blank">iDaaS Connect - Third Party</a>| This iDaaS Connect accelerator is specifically designed to receive data from several dozens connectors. The connectors include JDBC (any jdbc compliant data source with a jar), Kafka, FTP/sFTP and sFTP, AS400, HTTP(s), REST and many more.  Since this accelerator is built atop the upstream of Apache Camel this accelerator can leverage any <a href="https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/index.html" target="_blank">supported components</a>. This accelerator apart from handling the needed specific connectivity also does a minimal initial routing of data and has complete auditing integrated.|
|Routing - Data Distribution |<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Route" target="_blank">iDaaS Route</a>|This iDaaS Route component  is specifically implemented to help enable a decoupled enterprise integration pattern. The focus of this component is  solely on enabling data to be distributed with any implementation needs or requirements. The initial design pattern is termed the HCDD (healthcare data distribution) enterprise integration pattern.|
|Run (Transform and Re-Shape Data|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDAAS-DREAM/tree/master/iDaaS-EventBuilder" target="_blank">Event Builder</a>|This component is what enables Red Hat, partners, SIs and developers to develop, extend or enhance the platform's ability to process data into any type of needed custom format for any type of needed processing. iDaaS Event Builder is designed to call out and invoke needed events and can be customized based on business needs very quickly. The only thing past cloning the source code is setting up the appropriate way to include iDaaS Event Builder jar files so that it can be included. If you do not wish to leverage the existing code, enhance or extend it developers are able to add their own custom code for processing and object building.|
|Run (DREAM - Data Realtime Enablement)|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-DREAM/" target="_blank">iDaaS DREAM (Data Runtime Enterprise Automated Mgmt)</a>| DREAM's design intent is to enable Red Hat, partners, SIs and developers to implement iDaaS and/or other capabilities internal or external to iDaaS in a dynamic manner without the need for stopping the platform and needing to restart it to work with data while adding new features.|
|Research and Resolve|<a href="https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-KIC" target="_blank">iDaaS KIC (Knowledge, Insight and Compliance)</a>|iDaaS KIC is where audit and other related data for the platform is stored. Like the rest of iDaaS it is intended to be extensible. iDaaS Data KIC is a platform to enable processing of data into the various components and data models included. The key things Data Hub is meant to ensure resources have data driven insights from ANY activity the iDaaS platform will do. A key thing to note in the data model and events the system focuses on is a way to associate one organization to many healthcare entities and to many applications and within each application any components wished to be defined. This is ALL up to the implementation. Because of this data enablement iDaaS focuses on enabling a detailed eventing model to iDaaS Data Hub for any activities the system does, this specifically is done through a transaction event which has a rich set of data attributes to enable detailed insight.|
