# Overall Project Herophilus Background
For many decades, healthcare has relied upon community development in areas such as treatment protocols, safety standards, 
and common data formats. More recently, this "community" model has been used in software development; all significant 
software innovation in the past 10 years has been in open-source communities. Welcome to Project Herophilus, this 
organization is intended to be an open source upstream healthcare community. The intent of this organization is two 
fold: help drive open source into healthcare and demonstrate the how innovation in healthcare can drive and leverage 
open source to solve industry problems!!! Why the name? Herophilus or spelled Herophilos, was a Greek physician who 
is often credited with being the founder of Anatomy. Assets currently available provide tools for configuration, 
testing, data integration, synthetic data, and more - all developed and available to any organization. Project 
Herophilus has made these assets available to anyone using fully open source software and all under Apache 2 licensing.

Of the major efforts in Project Herophilus there is a major branded effort to provide a newer form of innovation
Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service). It is intended to be a <b> design pattern/reference architecture/accelerator </b> 
built atop industry-leading open-source software. The platform is constructed in a very modern cloud native manner ensuring 
that any component is designed and built for a specific purpose with scale and extensibility. 

Red Hat who is a leader in enterprise open source and offers support, security, services and training. In alignment with 
healthcare and technology's embrace of community and open source, Red Hat has been a key sponsor and supporter in 
establishing Project Herophilis. Red Hat is keeping its enterprise open source leading approach and operates a subset 
of these assets “downstream.” While the “accelerators” are provided as is, Red Hat customers can get secure and 
supported software the “accelerators” run atop for their production and other business needs.

Please feel free to go to our discussion  and/or issues areas in any of the specific repositories. We consider all 
feedback as we are looking to improve our design pattern/reference architecture. Any communication to these areas 
or the project owners influences our [Technical Roadmap](docs/Roadmap/index.md).

The sole purpose of ALL the capabilities we have built for healthcare is to enable <b> Data as an Asset</b>.
The major focus of our efforts is to enable Data Integration to become a mainstream application development enablement
and is all about Data Innovation and all the things you can achieve with access to the data.

Here is another way to think about data innovation with intelligent Daas.
