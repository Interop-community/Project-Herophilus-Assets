# Overall Project Herophilus Background
Open Source or the "community" development model has been used in software development for almost two decades. Over the 
last decade all significant software innovation in the past 10 years has been from open-source communities. Here is a
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>
that showcases all the various ways open source and it's culture is transforming the way not only software is delivery but 
changing the way new innovation is being delivered. Healthcare for many decades has also relied upon community development 
in areas such as treatment protocols, safety standards, and industry standards based data formats. Now, as we head into
a new era driven by comsumption and secure managed services it is a perfect time in healthcare for open source and 
healthcare.

Welcome to Project Herophilus, this Git Hub based organization is intended to be an open source upstream healthcare 
community with a specific focus around build data driven assets. The intent of this organization is two fold: help drive 
data driven open source capabilities into healthcare while demonstrating how healthcare can leverage open source to 
solve industry problems!!! Why the name? Herophilus or spelled Herophilos, Herophilus was a Greek physician who is often 
credited with being the founder of Anatomy. Assets currently available provide tools for configuration, testing, 
data integration, synthetic data, and more - all developed and available to any organization. Project Herophilus has 
made these assets available to anyone using fully open source software and all under Apache 2 licensing.

Of the major efforts in Project Herophilus there is a major branded effort to provide a newer form of innovation
Intelligent DaaS (Data as a Service). It is intended to be a <b> design pattern/reference architecture/accelerator </b> 
built atop industry-leading open-source software. The platform is constructed in a very modern cloud native manner ensuring 
that any component is designed and built for a specific purpose with scale and extensibility. The sole purpose of ALL the 
capabilities we have built for healthcare is to enable <b> Data as an Asset</b>. The major focus of our efforts is to 
reduce the risk and move Data Integration towards Data Innovation and enable it to move from a specific task based 
enabler to a mainstream application development enablement.

Red Hat who is a leader in enterprise open source and offers support, security, services and training. In alignment with 
healthcare and technology's embrace of community and open source, Red Hat has been a key sponsor and supporter of Project 
Herophilis. Red Hat is keeping its enterprise open source leading approach and operates a subset 
of these assets “downstream.” While the “accelerators” are provided as is, Red Hat customers can get secure and 
supported software the “accelerators” run atop for their production and other business needs. For more information please
feel to go to https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/. Several efforts from Project Herophilus are forked here and other 
branded efforts are named the same. Some of these cannot be forked as they leverage completely different libraries and 
go through a seperate build and testing process; however, the capabilities they deliver are the same.

Please feel free to go to our discussion  and/or issues areas in any of the specific repositories. We consider all 
feedback as we are looking to improve our design pattern/reference architecture. Any communication to these areas 
or the project owners influences our [Technical Roadmap](docs/Roadmap/index.md).
